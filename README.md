- 
![Wireframing](./images/design.jpg)

## :rocket: Cool tech
- Ruby, CSS, HTML
- Sinatra
- Heroku
- API

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- The quantity of furniture can be drop below 0.
- If the number of added cart furniture can not be seen on the page, then the update and donate funtion disabled. 


## :sob: Lessons learnt
- a rough database should be designed before everything setup
- login, sign up, donate pages have almost the same layout, I make them sharing the same CSS code

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- search functions become blur search
- add check out function
- add online enquiry function
